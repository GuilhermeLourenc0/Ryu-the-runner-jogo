# 🕹️ Ryu, the runner

A fun and interactive browser-based game that combines the simplicity of Google's **Dino Game** (played when you're offline) with the iconic style of **Street Fighter**. Test your reflexes as you navigate through obstacles in this exciting mash-up!

---

## 📖 Overview

This project is inspired by Google's famous **Dino Game**, the one you see on the Chrome browser when you lose your internet connection. Instead of a dinosaur, you take control of a character from the **Street Fighter** universe, dodging obstacles and racking up points. It's the perfect blend of nostalgia and action-packed fun!

> **Note**: The game logic is entirely developed in **JavaScript**, while **HTML** and **CSS** are only used to create the page structure and style for the game to run.

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Start the Game**: Open the game in your browser and press the spacebar to begin.
2. **Control Your Character**:
   - Press **Spacebar** to jump over obstacles.
3. **Goal**: Survive as long as possible and achieve the highest score.
